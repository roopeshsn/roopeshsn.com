It's a random thought, how I can peer my laptop with my friend's laptop using BGP where both the machines are behind CG-NAT. My broadband connection is from Airtel and I am not sure what my friend's is using - never mind. 

In CG-NAT the public IP address for example 223.123.12.23 will be shared by multiple broadband users. Inbound connections will fail unless there is a outbound connection created already for the same port number. For example say there are two parties A and B trying to establish a TCP communication, assuming X and Y are their ip addresses which is shared. A initiated the communication to B's ip address Y with port number 1234. Now when the SYN packet reaches it's CG-NAT router, it creates a mapping destination's ISP CG-NAT's router, it needs to have a mapping of Y:1234 to reach B. To have this mapping B should a  

<!-- Explain CG-NAT with NAT Table mapping -->

Secondly our machines linux/macos won't have BGP process by default. We can run the BGP daemon on our machines. Some of the popular ones that comes with BGP daemon are FRRouting, BIRD and others. I ran FRRouting on top of a VM (created using Multipass) on my Mac. This is sorted.

In the BGP daemon configuration we need two configurations for the neighborship to form,
- Neighbor IP address with ASN
- Changing the default TTL which is 1, so that the packet can be forwarded on the Internet routers

As said before one peer should communicate the CG-NAT port number to the other peer inorder the neighborship to be successful. To mitigate this we are forming VPN tunnels from the clients to the cloud VPS using Wireguard. 

<!-- Answer the questions:

As I work as a network engineer. I used to think and compare Wireguard with VXLAN. Wireguard and VXLAN are known as overlay encapsulation protocols, where the original frame will be encapsulated with another frame. The intermediate routers can only see the outer frame not the inner frame. The tunnel endpoints (VTEPs in VXLAN terminoogy) can decapsulate the inner frame and bridge/route it.

## Setup

Setup in a nutshell
1. Setting up a cloud VPS
2. Setting up Wireguard on the Cients and cloud VPS
3. Setting up FRRouting on Clients

### Cloud VPS

We can spin up a VPS with minimum available resouces on any cloud VPS provider. There are good reviews on Linode and Vultr. I am using Linode for setting up a VPS. On Linode we can use the "Nanode 1 GB" plan from the "Shared CPU" category. Below are the summary of the resources that comes with the Nanode plan.

```
Plan	Monthly	Hourly	RAM	CPUs	Storage	Transfer	Network In / Out
Nanode 1 GB	Nanode 1 GB  	$5	$0.0075	1 GB	1	25 GB	1 TB	40 Gbps / 1 Gbps
```

## Setting up Wireguard on the Clients and the VPS

1. Create public and private key

```
wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```

2. Create `wg0.conf` file to create the tunnel interface. The path is `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` meaning we need to create the `wg0.conf` file in the `/etc/wireguard` directory.

```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = yE790xX8JMFobo9EafDYu4ZQ+q0eADATLl1du8a9yWM=
Address = 10.0.0.10/24
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = LlKC4xwOJHlOetI7BLL+O4PUyEpYUHcFJA74RMzQpU8=
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32
```

In `AllowedIPs` field, we need to give the peer's tunnel interface address. If you are setting up in clients, the peer is the vps and vice versa. As other fields are self explanatory I leave them to you.

To bring the tunnel interfaces up we can use the wg-quick utility tool. Refer the below commands,

```
sudo wg-quick down wg0
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

Confirm the status of the tunnel interfaces using the command `wg` or `sudo wg`

We can also run the command `` to see the egress interface and next hop IP address.

## Setting up FRRouting

As I use Mac, I decided to install FRRouting on top of an Ubuntu VM. Spin up a VM using Multipass.

Install FRRouting by refering here: https://deb.frrouting.org/

Once FRRouting is installed, login to it using the command `vtysh`

Below are the required BGP configuration on the clients,

```
route-map ACCEPT-ALL permit 10
exit
!
router bgp <ASN>
 bgp router-id <ID>
 neighbor <NEIGHBOR_IP_ADDRESS> remote-as <NEIGHBOR_ASN>
 neighbor <NEIGHBOR_IP_ADDRESS> ebgp-multihop <TTL>
 !
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  neighbor <NEIGHBOR_IP_ADDRESS> route-map ACCEPT-ALL in
 exit-address-family
exit
```

```

Uncomment "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" in "/etc/sysctl.conf"
